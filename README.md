## About the Book
​​Building and managing secure applications is a crucial aspect of modern software development, especially in distributed environments. Kubernetes and Istio, when combined, provide a powerful platform for achieving application security and managing it effectively. If you want to build and manage secure applications with ease, then this book is an ideal resource for you.

The book extensively covers the building blocks of the Kubernetes orchestration engine, providing in-depth insights into key Kubernetes objects that can be effectively used for deploying containerized applications. It then focuses on all major Kubernetes constructs, offering guidance on their appropriate utilization in different scenarios, while emphasizing the significance of a Zero Trust architecture. Additionally, the book addresses important aspects such as service discovery, optimized logging, and monitoring, which play a critical role in managing distributed applications. It also incorporates essential concepts from Site Reliability Engineering and enabling engineering teams, to proactively meeting Service Level Agreements and attaining operational readiness. In the final section, the book takes a deep dive into Service Mesh, with a special focus on harnessing the strength of Istio as a powerful tool.

By the end of the book, you will have the knowledge and skills to effectively build, deploy, and manage secure applications using Kubernetes and Istio.
